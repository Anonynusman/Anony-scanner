# :red_square: Anony-scanner - _The Multi-Tool Web Vulnerability Scanner_


## Evolution:
> It is quite a fuss for a pentester to perform _**binge-tool-scanning**_ (_running security scanning tools one after the other_) sans automation. Unless you are a pro at automating stuff, it is a herculean task to perform binge-scan for each and every engagement. The ultimate goal of this program is to solve this problem through automation; viz. **running multiple scanning tools to discover vulnerabilities, effectively judge false-positives, collectively correlate results** and **saves precious time**; all these under one roof.<p>Enter **Anony-scanner**.

## Features
- **one-step installation**.
- **executes a multitude of security scanning tools**, does other **custom coded checks** and **prints the results spontaneously**.
- some of the tools include `nmap, dnsrecon, wafw00f, uniscan, sslyze, fierce, lbd, theharvester, dnswalk, golismero` etc executes under one entity.
- saves a lot of time, **indeed a lot time!**.
- **checks for same vulnerabilities with multiple tools** to help you **zero-in on false positives** effectively.
- **legends** to help you understand which tests may take longer time, so you can `Ctrl+C` to skip if needed.
- **association with OWASP Top 10 2017** on the list of vulnerabilities discovered. (_under development_)
- **critical, high, medium, low and informational** classification of vulnerabilities.
- **vulnerability definitions** guides you what the vulnerability actually is and the threat it can pose. (_~**under development**~_)
- **remediations** tells you how to plug/fix the found vulnerability. (_~**under development**~_)
- **executive summary** gives you an overall context of the scan performed with critical, high, low and informational issues discovered. (_under development_)
- **artificial intelligence** to deploy tools automatically depending upon the issues found. for eg; automates the launch of `wpscan` and `plecost` tools when a wordpress installation is found. (_under development_)
- **detailed comprehensive report** in a portable document format (*.pdf) with complete details of the scans and tools used. (_under development_)

### FYI:
- _program is still under development, **works** and currently supports **81** vulnerability tests._
- _parallel processing is not yet implemented, may be coded as more tests gets introduced._

## Vulnerability Checks
- :heavy_check_mark: DNS/HTTP Load Balancers & Web Application Firewalls.
- :heavy_check_mark: Checks for Joomla, WordPress and Drupal
- :heavy_check_mark: SSL related Vulnerabilities (_HEARTBLEED, FREAK, POODLE, CCS Injection, LOGJAM, OCSP Stapling_).
- :heavy_check_mark: Commonly Opened Ports.
- :heavy_check_mark: DNS Zone Transfers using multiple tools (_Fierce, DNSWalk, DNSRecon, DNSEnum_).
- :heavy_check_mark: Sub-Domains Brute Forcing (_DNSMap, amass, nikto_)
- :heavy_check_mark: Open Directory/File Brute Forcing.
- :heavy_check_mark: Shallow XSS, SQLi and BSQLi Banners.
- :heavy_check_mark: Slow-Loris DoS Attack, LFI (_Local File Inclusion_), RFI (_Remote File Inclusion_) & RCE (_Remote Code Execution_).
- & more coming up...

## Requirements
- Python 2.7
- Kali OS (_**Preferred**, as it is shipped with almost all the tools_)
- Tested with Parrot & Ubuntu Operating Systems.

## Usage (One Liner to Initiate the Scan - For Non-Forkers & Non-Cloners)
**Download the script, allow executable permissions & start the scan immediately**
- `wget -O rapidscan.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anonynusman/Anony-scanner/main/scan.py && chmod +x scan.py && ./scan.py example.com`

### With Docker
To run a scan for `example.com` the command below has to be run. After completion reports can be found in the current path under `reports`.
```
docker run -t --rm -v $(pwd)/reports:/reports kanolato/scan example.com
```
